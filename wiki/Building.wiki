#summary How to go about building the Linux Password Server

= Pre-Requisites =

You will need the development libraries for the following packages:
 * cyrus-sasl
 * openssl
 * cryptopp
 * openldap

You will also need the following SASL mechanisms installed:
 * cyrus-sasl-md5

If you are on a Fedora machine you can get those with
{{{
yum install cyrus-sasl-devel openssl-devel cryptopp-devel openldap-devel cyrus-sasl-md5
}}}

= Build =

Once you have those download the source code and extract it. Then run the *make* command from the lpws folder.

The Makefile is currently setup for a Fedora 64-bit system, but it should work on a 32-bit system as well and hopefully other systems.

= Installing =

Once you have run *make* to build you can run *make install* to install everything. The Makefile should currently support 32-bit or 64-bit Fedora systems. I don't know about other distributions yet, so your mileage may vary.

By default the SASL plug-ins will be installed in /usr/lib{64}/sasl2 and binaries will be installed in /usr/local/sbin, you can override where the binaries go but not the plug-ins:
{{{
make install prefix=/usr
}}}
... will install the binaries in /usr/sbin.

If you want to do a test-install to see where everything goes without actually dumping stuff into your system directories you can use the standard DESTDIR option to put everything under a different root, for example to install everything relative to a root of /tmp/lpws-install
{{{
make install DESTDIR=/tmp/lpws-install
}}}
